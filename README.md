# PODS-plotly-example
This repo contains a basic demonstration of [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) and [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly) using R as part of the [McGill's Policy and Data Science summer program](https://www.policyanddatascience.org/) in August 2018. A big thank you to the Meghan Keenan and all the interns for their love for data science!
